            <p>Part of the issue may be that underrepresented founders are often grouped into
                homogenous networks based
                on
                one
                unifying
                characteristic, for example, “female founders,” that fail to address how other social constructs like
                socio-economic
                class or migration status differentiate the needs of people within these larger groups. By grouping
                founders
                into
                single-axis dichotomies like male/female or white/BIPOC, policymakers, DEI initiatives, and ecosystem
                players
                miss
                opportunities to address the ways different inequities can be mutually reinforcing.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, entrepreneurial research has also traditionally explored founders’ experiences through
                single
                social
                categories. So we’ve used an intersectional approach in this report in order to gain a more holistic
                perspective on ways
                that overlapping social constructs can influence the motivation, experiences, and strategies for
