                    <p>The theory of intersectionality acknowledges that the interconnection between social
                        categorizations
                        such
                        as
                        age,
                        gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status can expose individuals to advantages and
                        disadvantages
                        that
                        uniquely shape
                        their experiences, as well as their social standing. The concept can be seen in almost all
                        facets of
                        life.
                        For
                        example,
                        Black women face disadvantages based on both race and gender. <sup><a

                        Similarly, working-class gay men might face
                        discrimination due to both their social class and sexual identity. For instance, there’s a wage
                        gap
                        between
                        men
                        and
                        women, but also between Black men and white women. In the US, a Black man and a white woman make
                        $0.74
                        and

        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The theory of intersectionality suggests that all forms of inequality are “mutually reinforcing and must
                therefore be
                analysed and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form from reinforcing "another". <sup><a

                        target="_blank">6</a></sup></p>
            <p>In Germany, there has been a significant uptake in DEI initiatives in the entrepreneurial ecosystem
                targeted
                at
                single
                dichotomy networks like women entrepreneurs or migrant founders. While created with positive intentions,
                research has
                found that creating these homogenous groups can be counterproductive, for example, by further
                marginalising
                minorities
                within the group, since a single-dichotomy network doesn’t adequately respond to intersectional
                discrimination.
            </p>
            <p>At Founderland, we’re dedicated to supporting women of colour founders, whose intersecting identities
                present
                them with
                needs and challenges that couldn’t be addressed by a group that focused on founders who are women or
                founders
                who are
                people of colour. While it’s not possible to completely address all forms of discrimination
                simultaneously,
                we’re
                looking at ways that this group of founders’ experiences might be affected through multiple lenses. The
                report
                aims to
                shed light on the heterogeneity of women entrepreneurs, and how they are distinctly positioned in their
                journeys
                by
                factors tied into and beyond their gender, including socio-economic status, ethnicity, age, and parental
                status.

                However, as the idea of intersectionality suggests, people’s life experiences, their identities, and

                into
                social constructs can play a major role in their lives. Research shows that the general motivations

            <p>Through our interviews, the founders shared that having children stagnated their career growth and often
                led to
                employers questioning their ability to focus and commit to full-time employment. As a result,
                entrepreneurship became a
                more enticing opportunity as it allows them to take back control of their career.
                Sadly, other founders shared that despite their desire to stay in the workforce, experiences of racism
                and
                discrimination forced them out.

                    One
                    report out of Harvard Business School discussed how male entrepreneurs are asked more
                    promotion-focused
                    questions, like “What does your venture forecast look like?” or “Where’s the opportunity?”,

                    female

            <p>According to the Morgan Stanley study, investors “don’t see the imbalance” in the amount of funding
                that
                goes
                to
                women
                and minority founders. Of the 101 investors they surveyed, 61% felt that women and minority founders
                get
                “about
                the
                right amount of capital” – and 20% believe that they get “more capital than they deserve.” Why is
                this,
                when
                we
                know a
                vast inequality exists based on the actual data? According to the study, investors lack exposure to
                and
                interaction with
                women and minority founders – another issue traced back to how homogenous the startup ecosystem
                is.<sup>

            <p>The lack of diversity among investors mirrors the state of funding for women of colour
                entrepreneurs:
            </p>
            <p>In Europe, only 15% of general partners are women, and it was found that they have fewer seats on
                investment committees
                and less clout than their male counterparts.<sup>

                working in VC or private equity are people of colour (11% are Asian, 3% are Black, and 7%
                identify
                as
                multi-ethnic or

            <p>The lack of diversity and homogeneity of the ecosystem contributes to challenges like access to

                or
                risk
                perception. While initiatives in the startup ecosystem approach the funding gap with bottom-up
                solutions.
                However, our
                research has uncovered that top-down solutions are required to bring about real change.
            </p>
            <p>Likewise, while there are many sources that provide women and minority entrepreneurs with suggestions
                on
                how
                to navigate
                and mitigate prejudice, this places another burden on them (ex. this article from Forbes <sup>

                onus
                should ultimately
                be on the investors and other members of the VC ecosystem to do the work themselves, looking into
                and
                checking their own
                biases, whether conscious or not.

            <p>The last challenge unveiled in our research was “Diversity Washing”, a term used to describe the
                process
                of
                conveying an
                image of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion by companies through initiatives in order to appear more
                positive
                and/or
                benefit from it. In the entrepreneurial ecosystem, this can be seen through deceptive marketing
                campaigns
                which fail to
                represent the reality of a company’s diversity. One of the interview participants shared the

            <p>We also need to look at whether DEI initiatives are truly changing circumstances for underrepresented
                founders, or if
                they’re only giving the appearance of change. There has been an uptake in DEI initiatives, including
                programs focused on
                women and minority founders and quotas targeted at these groups. But funding for women in Europe is
                still
                extremely low,
                with only 2% of venture capital going to all-women-led teams in 2021.<sup>

                    startups every day, but they are still holding on to their prejudices and are still doing things

                    can be considered

                    with diverse
                    founders that have to interact with that same company, without necessarily making it into that

                    for me, the
