    <h2>Intersectionality & Motivations</h2>

</div>
<div id="2-1-1">
    <h3>What is intersectionality?</h3>
    <p>The term intersectionality was first coined in 1989 by American professor Kimberlé Crenshaw to describe how
        systems of
        inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class, and other
        forms of
        discrimination “intersect” to create unique experiences of oppression and privilege.

            <p>The theory of intersectionality acknowledges that the interconnection between social categorizations such
                as
                age,
                gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status can expose individuals to advantages and disadvantages that
                uniquely shape
                their experiences, as well as their social standing. The concept can be seen in almost all facets of
                life.
                For
                example,
                Black women face disadvantages based on both race and gender. <sup><a
                        href="https://helpfulprofessor.com/examples-of-intersectionality/" target="_blank">4</a></sup>
                Similarly, working-class gay men might face
                discrimination due to both their social class and sexual identity. For instance, there’s a wage gap
                between
                men
                and
                women, but also between Black men and white women. In the US, a Black man and a white woman make $0.74
                and
                $0.78
                to a
                white man's dollar. <sup><a href="https://www.intersectionaljustice.org/what-is-intersectionality"

    <h3>Implications in the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>The theory of intersectionality suggests that all forms of inequality are “mutually reinforcing and must
        therefore be
        analysed and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form from reinforcing "another". <sup><a
                href="https://www.ywboston.org/2017/03/what-is-intersectionality-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-me/#:~:text=Intersectionality%20recognizes%20that%20identity%20markers,a%20white%20man%27s%20dollar%2C%20respectively."
                target="_blank">6</a></sup></p>
    <p>In Germany, there has been a significant uptake in DEI initiatives in the entrepreneurial ecosystem targeted at
        single
        dichotomy networks like women entrepreneurs or migrant founders. While created with positive intentions,
        research has
        found that creating these homogenous groups can be counterproductive, for example, by further marginalising
        minorities
        within the group, since a single-dichotomy network doesn’t adequately respond to intersectional discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>At Founderland, we’re dedicated to supporting women of colour founders, whose intersecting identities present
        them with
        needs and challenges that couldn’t be addressed by a group that focused on founders who are women or founders
        who are
        people of colour. While it’s not possible to completely address all forms of discrimination simultaneously,
        we’re
        looking at ways that this group of founders’ experiences might be affected through multiple lenses. The report
        aims to
        shed light on the heterogeneity of women entrepreneurs, and how they are distinctly positioned in their journeys
        by
        factors tied into and beyond their gender, including socio-economic status, ethnicity, age, and parental status.

                However, as the idea of intersectionality suggests, people’s life experiences, their identities, and
                where they fit
                into
                social constructs can play a major role in their lives. Research shows that the general motivations for
                men and
                women to
                start their businesses are similar overall, however, we wanted to see what the most common motivations
                might be
                among
                women of colour founders, who often face multiple intersectional challenges because of their race,
                ethnicity,
                gender,
                socio-economic status, and migration status.

    <h3>Experiences of Discrimination</h3>

            <p>Discrimination is an all-encompassing term for unjust treatment based on the groups, classes, and
                categories that an
                individual belongs to or is perceived to belong to 2, 3.</p>
            <p>While speaking with founders during the research process, we noted experiences of discrimination as a
                major reason these
                founders decided to start their ventures.</p>

                to create
                something, move up, and build my own success story, I have to do my own thing. ’

    <h3>The Glass Ceiling</h3>
    <div class="mixed-col">
        <div class="md:col-span-7">
            <p>One of the most notable forms of discrimination faced by this demographic of founders before starting
                their companies
                was the prejudicial barriers that hindered career mobility, also known as “The Glass Ceiling”. The glass
                ceiling is an
                unacknowledged barrier to professional advancement due to discrimination such as racism and sexism. It
                especially
                affects women and members of minority communities 4.
            </p>
            <p>Research has found that the appealing opportunity to have more control over their careers is a major
                motivator for women
                to leave their corporate careers to pursue entrepreneurial endeavours 5, pg. 4. According to the second
                annual Global
                Entrepreneurship survey, 61% of founders shared that becoming their own boss was a motivator for
                starting their company.
                62% of women cited unfair treatment such as fewer opportunities (33%) for promotion and unequal pay
                (31%) in previous
                roles as the catalyst for starting a business.</p>
            <p>Similarly, 43% of the women surveyed shared that they delayed starting a family for fear that it would
                negatively impact
                their careers, while 25% of the women surveyed shared that they faced pregnancy discrimination 6, 7.
                Another study found
                that women with children are 79% less likely to be hired than women without children 8. In Germany, a
                survey conducted
                by the anti-discrimination agency found that six percent of women had been asked if they were pregnant
                even though such
                a question is inadmissible by law 9.
            </p>
            <p>Through our interviews, the founders shared that having children stagnated their career growth and often
                led to
                employers questioning their ability to focus and commit to full-time employment. As a result,
                entrepreneurship became a
                more enticing opportunity as it allows them to take back control of their career.
                Sadly, other founders shared that despite their desire to stay in the workforce, experiences of racism
                and
                discrimination forced them out.

        <p>Experiences of discrimination take on numerous forms. For some, it can occur before getting a job. For
            example, the
            German Federal Anti-Discrimination agency found that people with "foreign-sounding names" were 24% less
            likely than
            those with German names to be called in for an interview 10. Similarly, 18% of respondents surveyed shared
            that they
            were asked if German was their native language and 15% what their religious affiliation was 11. Findings
            like these
            indicate that discrimination can have a significant impact on employment opportunities. </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, discrimination doesn’t stop at recruiting. In Germany, workplace discrimination is becoming
            increasingly
            prevalent. Before the pandemic, workplace discrimination was growing by 10-15% annually in Germany, which
            saw a
            significant increase to almost 79% during the pandemic 12. According to the Global Entrepreneurship survey,
            62% of women
            entrepreneurs shared that they wanted to start a business due to unfair treatment at the workplace 13.
            Difficulty
            finding a job and mistreatment in the workforce can prompt groups facing discrimination to choose
            self-employment.</p>
        <p>
            Despite these negative experiences, the many founders including the ones we interviewed were able to channel
            the
            hardships to create impactful businesses, which segues into the next motivator for starting a venture:
            Mission. Impact.

    <h3>Opposites do not always attract!</h3>
    <div class="mixed-col mb-12">
        <div class="md:col-span-8 ">
            <p>Through our primary research, the first challenge identified was the issue of “homophily networks,” a
                sociological
                theory that people with similar characteristics have an inclination to consciously or unconsciously
                group themselves
                together 1, 2. People tend to gravitate towards others with similar characteristics or backgrounds, like
                gender,
                educational and professional experience, or culture, because these similarities create an environment of
                trust that is
                more conducive to cooperation. Additionally, homophily networks act as a way to pre-vet individuals. For
                example, in the
                context of investing, there is a preference to commit capital to a founder within one’s network or to a
                founder who has
                a similar background (education, professional experience, age, etc…). This mitigates the feeling of risk
                and fosters
                more trust in their abilities to create a successful venture. 3, 4</p>

            <p>Within the context of entrepreneurship, this can be seen in many different forms. For example, according
                to the
                Deutscher Startup Monitor, 36.4% of founders met their co-founders in university, 34.5% were friends,
                28.2% from a
                common previous employer, and 23% met through a mutual connection 5. This is significant for the
                diversity of the
                startup scene since homophily networks also have a big impact on founders that are seeking funding – and
                because of
                this, tend to reinforce and perpetuate inequities.</p>

    <p>One central and very pronounced type of homophily network we looked at is education. In Germany, for
        instance, almost
        one in four founders (24%) studied at what is considered to be the “top ten” list of the country’s
        entrepreneurial
        universities 6. This homogenous educational background is even more pronounced in the US, where a study led
        by Harvard
        Professor Paul Gompers, Eugene Holman, and Silpa Kovvali revealed that nearly one in four venture
        capitalists studied at
        Harvard – in a country with thousands of higher education institutions 7. Our research team conducted an
        analysis of
        where venture capital investors from Germany’s top* VCs and unicorn founders studied. We found that nearly
        42% studied
        at the following universities: The Technical University of Munich (TUM) (15%), WHU- Otto Beisheim School of
        Management
        (13%), University of St.Gallen (9%), and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) (5%). Similarly, the
        educational
        composition of German unicorn founders was similar with 41% having studied at the same institutions: The
        Technical
        University of Munich (TUM) (15%), WHU- Otto Beisheim School of Management (11%), University of St.Gallen
        (5%), and
        Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) (9%). While these findings do not imply causality, they do
        highlight a
        strong correlation between educational background and network. Lastly, 52% of the unicorn co-founders
        studied at the
        same universities.

    <p>In the next section, we’ll explore how homophily networks can influence access to information, networks, and risk
        perception.

        <p>Similarly, homophily networks and preferences also have a significant impact on founders that are seeking
            funding. A study conducted by Harvard professor Paul Gompers and research associate Silpa Kovvali revealed
            that the VC world is “incredibly homogenous”. In the US, nearly 25% of venture capitalists studied at
            Harvard (source). In Germany, it was uncovered that 24% of founders studied at what is classified as the top
            10 entrepreneurial universities in the country (source). (link to where vcs study if possible. Say something
            along the lines of: Our research team conducted an analysis of where vc’s in germany studied. Learned that
            ##% studied at these 10 universities and it comes as no surprise that ## of the ## German unicorn startups
            had founders that studied at these institutions and backed by investors from these unis).</p>
        <p>While the data provides a glance into homophily networks in the German startup scene, the following sections
            explains its influence on access to information, networks, and risk perception. </p>

<div id="2-3-3">
    <h3>Proving themselves more & perception of being riskier</h3>
    <p class="lead">The biggest complaints made by women business owners revolved around the issue of having to deal
        with the prejudicial attitudes of others. Often, they had to deal with the inferior opinions others had about
        their intellectual and educational capabilities because of the colour of their skins and ethnic background.</p>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p>Once women and non-white business owners do get a foot in the door, they have to go the extra mile to prove
            their redeeming qualities, and overcome higher perceptions of risk, than their white, male counterparts.</p>
        <p>What does it mean to be an entrepreneur? What comes to mind when someone says entrepreneur?</p>
        <p>Role incongruity theory holds that individuals often find incongruities between their ideas of leadership and
            their female gender role expectations. This leads to discrimination when women are viewed less favorably
            than men as potential leaders because expected behaviors for their gender roles are inconsistent with
            attributions of leadership (Eagly and Karau 2002).</p>
        <p>Prejudice also happens when prescribed behaviors filled by a leader are viewed less favorably when they are
            enacted by a woman. The result is that attitudes toward female leaders are less positive, which in turn
            creates barriers for women becoming leaders and achieving leadership success (Source)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Sex-role stereotyping happens when men are respected more in business leadership roles because they are believed
        to possess the masculine traits that are deemed necessary for leadership (Eagly and Mitchell 2004) and are
        associated with high-growth entrepreneurial ventures, whereas women are associated with low-growth ventures.
        This particularly occurs and is reinforced in contexts where men are far often than women to be found in
        leadership positions and in entrepreneurship (Elam et al. 2019; Markussen and Røed 2017; Shahriar 2018).
        (Bullough, et. al.) </p>
    <p>Research has shown that because women are often associated with being feminine, communal, and compassionate
        (Ferriman et al. 2009) as opposed to assertive, dominating, and independent, which are characteristics
        associated more often with men, an incongruity between roles occurs when women’s gender roles—caregiving and
        nurturing—are at odds with perceived leadership characteristics—assertive and competitive (Eagly and Mitchell
        2004; Gupta et al. 2019; Powell et al. 2002). These male–female stereotypes, biases, and gender role
        expectations make entrepreneurial success and growth harder for women than for men, leading to the lacking of
        funding capital for their businesses (Gupta et al. 2019; Prasad 2009) and smaller professional networks
        (Kalafatoglu and Mendoza 2017; Mitra and Basit 2019)</p>
    <p>It is widely recognized that concepts of “entrepreneurship” and “entrepreneur” have been historically and
        culturally (re)produced on masculine terms (Ahl, 2002; Ahl and Marlow, 2012; Mirchandani, 1999; Bruni et al.,
        2004a, b; Lewis, 2006, 2009). Consequently, women and men have learned to become entrepreneurs against the
        masculine norm. The masculine norm is utilized as the “yardstick” (Mirchandani, 1999, p. 233) to measure the
        extent to which both women and men demonstrate “successful” – masculine – entrepreneurial traits and behaviors
        (Mirchandani, 1999; Simpson and Lewis, 2005). This presents a paradox for women as they are never able to fit in
        as they embody difference and jolt assumptions of what is deemed acceptable entrepreneuring within a female body
        (Ahl and Marlow, 2012)</p>

</div>
<div id="2-3-4">
    <h3>Funding</h3>
    <p class="lead">A Morgan Stanley-funded survey of 101 investors found that nearly 60 percent believe women and
        minority-owned businesses receive “about the right amount of capital” while 20 percent believe they receive
        “more capital than they deserve”</p>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p>One of the key differences appears to relate to access to capital. Buttner (1999) argues that starting with a
            smaller capital base may disadvantage women SME owners, as a lack of working capital is one of the biggest
            problems for start-ups. Indeed, this poorer capital base may be reflected in survival rates and subsequent
            growth opportunities. (Source) </p>
        <p>Further, these women often faced problems in accessing financial support, as they were often restricted from
            seeking financial support outside their own community or if there were no restriction, they were often
            denied access to mainstream financial support in the same way as their White female counterparts (Dawe and
            Fielden, 2005).</p>
        <p>a number of researchers (Jones et al., 1994; Levent et al., 2003) have suggested that members of ethnic
            minority communities did face additional barriers in accessing financing, particularly at start-ups. For
            instance, in a study of 232 BAME and 171 White UK business owners, Jones et al. (1994) reported that African
            and Caribbean businesses (39 per cent) and Asian owned businesses (29 per cent) demonstrated higher
            propensities to report problems in assessing bank financing than their White counterparts (21 per cent).
            More recently, Ram et al. (2001) confirmed that African Caribbean businesses had less success in accessing
            bank loans and greater problems providing adequate collateral for bank loans.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, a number of studies (Carter et al., 2001; Marlow and Pattern, 2005) have revealed that female owned
        firms underperformed in almost every respect in comparison to those owned by males because of under
        capitalization. Drawing from an extensive review of the literature and empirical data, Carter (2000, p. 174)
        concluded that male business owners “used three times more start-up capital than women” and this was related
        significantly and positively to the current value of capital assets, sales turnover and total number of
        employees. Access to financial capital is critical during business start-up and undercapitalization during
        enterprise formation and development leads to underperformance during the life of the business (Shaw et al.,
        2009). If women are limited to borrowing money from their spouses or families, then they are limited by the
        financial resources with the family group. Moreover, if the family do not approve of their venture they can
        effectively prevent them from proceeding with their business venture.</p>
    <p>Part of the reason WMBE are smaller and having slower growth rates is their initial capitalization levels- the
        early life lines of funds that help get businesses off the ground.</p>
    <p>What perpetuates the funding gap? There are a broad range of historic, cultural, and systemic factors that
        created and contribute to this disparity in funding — and which help perpetuate it today. Many of these have
        been well-documented: The lack of gender and racial diversity among the investment community, a reliance on
        well-established social networks, and bias (both deliberate and unconscious). </p>
</div>
<div id="2-3-5">
    <h3>Funding Implications</h3>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p class="lead">Financial institutions need to ensure the BAME women business owners have equal access to
            financial services and in some cases, institutions could benefit from introducing alternative finance
            options such as Islamic financial instruments, asset-based finance and profit-sharing schemes.</p>
        <p class="">The top three challenges when starting a business were revealed to all revolve around money —
            earning enough money to offset costs (51%), having enough budget to grow (51%) and financing their business
            (48%).</p>
