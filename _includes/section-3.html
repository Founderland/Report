        <p>Only 1% of women-led startups and 0.7% of ethnic minority founders received VC funding in Europe in 2021 1.
            This
            can
            make one feel that the state of the European startup ecosystem is a lost cause, but there is power in
            numbers,
            and hope
            when we come together to support the creation of equity for all founders 2, 3. Whether you’re a founder,

                Create a visa that makes it easier for people with migration backgrounds to start a company in Germany.
                Every fifth
                startup in Germany is founded by a person with a migration background; however, they frequently face
                obstacles due to
                their migration status. A successful example of this is the French Tech Visa for startup employees,
                founders, and
                investors 6
