<div id="3-1">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Women founders are not a homogenous group</li>
        <li>Founders are judged based on numerous factors outside of just gender and ethnicity. They are assessed on their migrant status, socio-economic status, family status, etc. Additionally, the opportunities and challenges allotted to them are also because of these factors</li>
        <li>You will get an understanding of the current entrepreneurial landscape, insights into the experiences of these founders, and actionable steps to support the creation of a level playing field </li>
    </ul>

<div id="3-2">
    <h2>Intersectionality</h2>

    <h3>What is intersectionality?</h3>
    <p class="lead">The term intersectionality was first coined in 1989 by professor Kimberlé Crenshaw to describe the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class and other forms of discrimination “intersect” to create unique experiences of oppression and privelege.<sup><a href="https://www.intersectionaljustice.org/what-is-intersectionality" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://www.womankind.org.uk/intersectionality-101-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-important/#:~:text=Intersectionality%20is%20the%20acknowledgement%20that,orientation%2C%20physical%20ability%2C%20etc." target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination" target="_blank">3</a></sup></p>
    <p class="text-col">The theory of intersectionality acknowledges that the interconnection between social categorizations (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status) can expose individuals to advantages and disadvantages that uniquely shape their experiences, as well as their social standing. The concept can be seen in almost all facets of life. For example, Black women face disadvantage based on both race and gender. Similarly, working-class gay men might face discrimination due to both their social class and sexual identity. Examples can also be seen practically in life. For example, a black man and a white woman make $0.74 and $0.78 to a white man's dollar.</p>  

    <h3>Implications in the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem</h3>
    <p class="lead">In Germany, there has been a significant uptake in DEI initiatives in the entrepreneurial ecosystem targeted at single dichotomy networks such as women entrepreneurs and migrant founders. While created with positive intentions, research has found that the creation of these homogenous groups can lead to counterproductive effects such as further marginalizing minorities within the group due to inadequate responses to intersectional discrimination.</p>
    <p class="text-col">The theory of intersectionality postulates that all forms of inequality are “mutually reinforcing and must therefore be analyzed and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form from reinforcing another'' (source 1). Naturally, it is not possible to simultaneously address all forms of discrimation. As a result, this report aims to shed light on the heterogeneity of women entrepreneurs and how they are distinctly positioned in their journeys due to factors such as socio-economic status, ethnicity, age, parental status, and more.</p>

    <h2>Motivators</h2>

        <blockquote>“Most entrepreneurs are born out of either opportunity, or necessity.”</blockquote>
        <!-- <figcaption></figcaption> -->
    </figure>
    <p class="lead">Academic research has found that there is no conclusive difference between men's and women’s motivation to start a business. Instead, founders are influenced by factors such as psychological motivations (e.g., achievement), economic necessity, environmental influence, and opportunities for social mobility (source). Likewise, the founders in our study highlighted three reasons for wanting to start their venture:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Experiences of Discrimination</li>
        <li>Passion. Purpose. Freedom.</li>
        <li>Background & Prior Experience</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Experiences of Discrimination</h3>
    <div class="mixed-col">
        <div class="md:col-span-5">
            <p class="lead">Discrimination is an all-encompassing term for unjust treatment based on the groups, classes, and categories that an individual belongs to or is perceived to belong to (source).</p>
            <p>During the research process, experiences of discrimination were noted as a reason these founders decided to create their ventures and embark on their entrepreneurial journey.</p>            
        </div>

            <blockquote>“I felt like I was hitting a ceiling and it already took a lot for me to get there… and having kids did not help. It definitely made people not consider me for new positions and opportunities. That's where I said, 'Okay, if I'm going to create something, move up, and build my own success story, I have to do my own thing.'”</blockquote>

    <h3>The Glass Ceiling</h3>
    <div class="mixed-col">
        <div class="md:col-span-7">
            <p class="lead">One of the most notable forms of discrimination faced by this demographic of founders before starting their companies were the prejudicial barriers that hindered career mobility, also known as “The Glass Ceiling”. The glass ceiling is an unacknowledged barrier to professional advancement due to discrimination such as racism and sexism. It especially affects women and members of minority communities (source).</p>
            <p>Research has found that the appealing opportunity to have more control over their careers is a major motivator for women to leave their corporate careers to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors (source pg. 4). According to the second annual Global Entrepreneurship survey, 61% of founders shared that becoming their own boss was a motivator for starting their company. 62% of women cited unfair treatment such as fewer opportunities (33%) for promotion and unequal pay (31%) in previous roles as the catalyst for starting a business.</p>
            <p>Similarly, 43% of the women surveyed shared that they delayed starting a family for fear that it would negatively impact their careers. Another study found that women with children are 79% less likely to be hired than women without children (source)</p>

            <p>Sadly, other founders shared that despite their desire to stay in the workforce, experiences of racism and discrimination forced them out.</p>

        <blockquote>"I was forced to leave my job because of discrimination, and after that, I became so lonely and isolated... The idea (for my business) came because I asked myself, 'Why do people hate each other or discriminate?' The answer is because they don't know each other."</blockquote>

    <div class="text-col">
        <p>Experiences of discrimination take on numerous forms. For some, it can occur prior to getting a job. For example, the German Federal Anti-Discrimination agency found that people with "foreign-sounding names" were 24% less likely than those with German names to be called in for an interview (source). Of the 2.27 million unemployed people in Germany in 2019, the Federal Employment Agency said that an overwhelming 46% of those people were not ethnic Germans, despite the fact that they are only 23% of the population. Findings like these indicate that discrimination can have a significant impact on employment opportunities, which can prompt groups facing discrimination to choose self-employment.</p>
        <p>Prior to the pandemic, workplace discimination was growing 10-15 percent annually in Germany, which saw a significant increase to almost 79% during the pandemic (source). According to the Global Entrepreneurship survey, 62% of women entrepreneurs shared that they wanted to start a business due to unfair treatment at the workplace (source). Despite these negative experiences, the founders were able to channel the hardships to create impactful businesses, which segues into the next motivator for starting a venture: Mission. Impact. Purpose.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Mission. Purpose. Passion.</h3>
    [word cloud]
    <p class="lead">According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, nearly 45% of the world's social entrepreneurs are female. Within Germany, the portion is higher at nearly 50% (source). Similarly, research has uncovered that ethnic minority founders are twice as likely to start a social enterprise. Based on these insights, it comes as no surprise that over 80% of the founders interviewed have founded impact ventures.</p>
    <div class="mixed-col md:place-items-center">
        <figure class="md:col-span-6">
            <blockquote>"It's time for me to try (entrepreneurship) and really solve a problem that I'm passionate about."</blockquote>

        </figure>    
        <div class="md:col-span-6">
            <p>Whether driven by experiences of discrimination or the desire to work on a mission that resonates with their interests, it is clear from the research that this group of founders are intrinsically motivated to create positive impact. For some founders, the opportunity to be the role model that they never got the opportunity to meet when they were growing up. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Survey, 80% of respondents shared that becoming a role model was a major motivation for starting a business. Others share their desire to dismantle the glass ceiling by hiring more diverse talent and closing the pay gap, were prime motivators. Others shared a strong desire to create a better future for younger generations by creating ventures focused on sustainable models such as reducing waste and recycling.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p class="lead">While there is no surprise that there are a range of challenges impacting these founders, it is apparent that their challenges are as unique as they are. Below are four of the main challenges we identified.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Homophily Networks</li>
        <li>Prejudice</li>
        <li>Funding</li>
        <li>Diversity Washing</li>
    </ul>
     
    <h3>Opposites do not always attract!</h3>
    <p class="lead">Through our research, the first challenge identified was the phenomenon of homophily networks, which is a sociological theory that people with similar characteristics have an inclination to (un)consciously group themselves together (source, source). People tend to gravitate towards others with similar characteristics (e.g., gender, educational and professional background, and culture) because homophily incites trust, tolerance, and cooperation, as well as a higher expected payoff from the interaction (source, source). Within the context of entrepreneurship, this can be seen in numerous forms. For example, 36.4% met their co-founders in university, 34.5% were friends, 28.2% from a common previous employer, and 23% through a mutual connection (source).</p>

    <div class="text-col">
        <p>Similarly, homophily networks and preferences also have a significant impact on founders that are seeking funding. A study conducted by Harvard professor Paul Gompers and research associate Silpa Kovvali revealed that the VC world is “incredibly homogenous”. In the US, nearly 25% of venture capitalists studied at Harvard (source). In Germany, it was uncovered that 24% of founders studied at what is classified as the top 10 entrepreneurial universities in the country (source).  (link to where vcs study if possible. Say something along the lines of: Our research team conducted an analysis of where vc’s in germany studied. Learned that ##% studied at these 10 universities and it comes as no surprise that ## of the ## German unicorn startups had founders that studied at these institutions and backed by investors from these unis).</p>
        <p>While the data provides a glance into homophily networks in the German startup scene, the following sections explains its influence on access to information, networks, and risk perception. </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Proving themselves more & perception of being riskier</h3>
    <p class="lead">The biggest complaints made by women business owners revolved around the issue of having to deal with the prejudicial attitudes of others. Often, they had to deal with the inferior opinions others had about their intellectual and educational capabilities because of the colour of their skins and ethnic background.</p>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p>Once women and non-white business owners do get a foot in the door, they have to go the extra mile to prove their redeeming qualities, and overcome higher perceptions of risk, than their white, male counterparts.</p>
        <p>What does it mean to be an entrepreneur? What comes to mind when someone says entrepreneur?</p>
        <p>Role incongruity theory holds that individuals often find incongruities between their ideas of leadership and their female gender role expectations. This leads to discrimination when women are viewed less favorably than men as potential leaders because expected behaviors for their gender roles are inconsistent with attributions of leadership (Eagly and  Karau 2002).</p>
        <p>Prejudice also happens when prescribed behaviors filled by a leader are viewed less favorably when they are enacted by a woman. The result is that attitudes toward female leaders are less positive, which in turn creates barriers for women becoming leaders and achieving leadership success (Source)</p>    
    </div>
    <p>Sex-role stereotyping happens when men are respected more in business leadership roles because they are believed to possess the masculine traits that are deemed necessary for leadership (Eagly and Mitchell  2004) and are associated with high-growth entrepreneurial ventures, whereas women are associated with low-growth ventures. This particularly occurs and is reinforced in contexts where men are far often than women to be found in leadership positions and in entrepreneurship (Elam et al. 2019; Markussen and Røed  2017; Shahriar 2018). (Bullough, et. al.) </p>
    <p>Research has shown that because women are often associated with being feminine, communal, and compassionate (Ferriman et al. 2009) as opposed to assertive, dominating, and independent, which are characteristics associated more often with men, an incongruity between roles occurs when women’s gender roles—caregiving and nurturing—are at odds with perceived  leadership characteristics—assertive and competitive  (Eagly and Mitchell 2004; Gupta et al. 2019; Powell  et al. 2002). These male–female stereotypes, biases, and gender role expectations make entrepreneurial success and growth harder for women than for men, leading to  the lacking of funding capital for their businesses  (Gupta et al. 2019; Prasad 2009) and smaller professional networks (Kalafatoglu and Mendoza 2017; Mitra  and Basit 2019)</p>
    <p>It is widely recognized that concepts of “entrepreneurship” and “entrepreneur” have been historically and culturally (re)produced on masculine terms (Ahl, 2002; Ahl and Marlow,  2012; Mirchandani, 1999; Bruni et al., 2004a, b; Lewis, 2006, 2009). Consequently, women and  men have learned to become entrepreneurs against the masculine norm. The masculine norm is utilized as the “yardstick” (Mirchandani, 1999, p. 233) to measure the extent to  which both women and men demonstrate “successful” – masculine – entrepreneurial traits and behaviors (Mirchandani, 1999; Simpson and Lewis, 2005). This presents a paradox for  women as they are never able to fit in as they embody difference and jolt assumptions of  what is deemed acceptable entrepreneuring within a female body (Ahl and Marlow, 2012)</p>

    <h3>Funding</h3>
    <p class="lead">A Morgan Stanley-funded survey of 101 investors found that nearly 60 percent believe women and minority-owned businesses receive “about the right amount of capital” while 20 percent believe they receive “more capital than they deserve”</p>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p>One of the key differences appears to relate to access to capital. Buttner (1999) argues that starting with a smaller capital base may disadvantage women SME owners, as a lack of working capital is one of the biggest problems for start-ups. Indeed, this poorer capital base may be reflected in survival rates and subsequent growth opportunities. (Source) </p>
        <p>Further, these women often faced problems in accessing financial support, as they were often restricted from seeking financial support outside their own community or if there were no restriction, they were often denied access to mainstream financial support in the same way as their White female counterparts (Dawe and Fielden, 2005).</p>
        <p>a number of researchers (Jones et al., 1994; Levent et al., 2003) have suggested that members of ethnic minority communities did face additional barriers in accessing financing, particularly at start-ups. For instance, in a study of 232 BAME and 171 White UK business owners, Jones et al. (1994) reported that African and Caribbean businesses (39 per cent) and Asian owned businesses (29 per cent) demonstrated higher propensities to report problems in assessing bank financing than their White counterparts (21 per cent). More recently, Ram et al. (2001) confirmed that African Caribbean businesses had less success in accessing bank loans and greater problems providing adequate collateral for bank loans.</p>    
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, a number of studies (Carter et al., 2001; Marlow and Pattern, 2005) have revealed that female owned firms underperformed in almost every respect in comparison to those owned by males because of under capitalization. Drawing from an extensive review of the literature and empirical data, Carter (2000, p. 174) concluded that male business owners “used three times more start-up capital than women” and this was related significantly and positively to the current value of capital assets, sales turnover and total number of employees. Access to financial capital is critical during business start-up and undercapitalization during enterprise formation and development leads to underperformance during the life of the business (Shaw et al., 2009). If women are limited to borrowing money from their spouses or families, then they are limited by the financial resources with the family group. Moreover, if the family do not approve of their venture they can effectively prevent them from proceeding with their business venture.</p>
    <p>Part of the reason WMBE are smaller and having slower growth rates is their initial capitalization levels- the early life lines of funds that help get businesses off the ground.</p>
    <p>What perpetuates the funding gap? There are a broad range of historic, cultural, and systemic factors that created and contribute to this disparity in funding — and which help perpetuate it today. Many of these have been well-documented: The lack of gender and racial diversity among the investment community, a reliance on well-established social networks, and bias (both deliberate and unconscious). </p> 
    
    <h3>Funding Implications</h3>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p class="lead">Financial institutions need to ensure the BAME women business owners have equal access to financial services and in some cases, institutions could benefit from introducing alternative finance options such as Islamic financial instruments, asset-based finance and profit-sharing schemes.</p>
        <p class="">The top three challenges when starting a business were revealed to all revolve around money — earning enough money to offset costs (51%), having enough budget to grow (51%) and financing their business (48%).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Coping & Strategies</h2>

    <h3>Overall</h3>
    <p class="lead">For many currently holding power in the industry, change is going to have to come with a complete overhaul of culture and mindset, as several of the investors and entrepreneurs I spoke to highlighted. “I think people keep thinking of diversity as a pie [chart]. I don’t think it’s a pie.” Corral says. “I don’t think by giving someone more access you’re taking something away from someone else.”</p>
