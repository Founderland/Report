    <p>Three women, Alina Bassi, Stephanie von Behr, and Deborah Choi – were tired the status quo in the ecosystem and
        wanted
        to challenge the way things were done. When it came to who got access to exclusive networking events with all
        “the right
        people;” the ways enviable keynote speaking opportunities were circulated, decided, and compensated; how
        homogenous
        those who held check writing power appeared; how very few women who were not white got funded, supported, and
        seen. They
        found each other and launched a community that became what Founderland is today: a non-profit organisation based
        in
        Germany that is focused on building a new inclusive, intersectional standard for entrepreneurs. Their work
        supports
        women of colour founders navigating the entrepreneurial ecosystem by levelling the playing field: providing them
        with a
        safe community, inspiring events, educational resources, funding opportunities, corporate perks, and access to
        networks
        to build their ventures.
    </p>
    <p>In July 2021, CoAct, a project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,
        held an
        open call for European Civil Society Initiatives to conduct Citizen Social Science (CSS) Research. Founderland
        was
        selected in the Gender Equality & Sustainable Cities and Communities category and provided with additional
        mentorship
        from faculty at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP).
    </p>
    <p>In line with the Citizen Social Science methodology, four women of colour founders from Founderland’s community
        were
        selected as co-researchers, which meant that they actively took on the role of researchers by conducting both
        primary
        and secondary research. Find out more about the team, their motivations, and the research methodology below:

    <img src="assets/images/metodology2.png" alt="diagram illustrating the metodology used and detailed below">
    <p>For this research, we used both the Citizen Social Science methodology and qualitative research approach to
        gather
        and
        interpret data.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the Citizen Social Science Methodology?</h3>
    <p>The Citizen Social Science (CSS) Methodology is a form of participatory social research that directly involves
        selected
        communities in the research process. It aims to provide citizen groups with an equal seat at the table by
        actively
        involving them in the research process, from conception through concrete actions.</p>
    <p>In alignment with CSS methodology, four women of colour founders based in Germany joined the project as
        co-researchers.
        In their roles, they supported the research design, conducted both primary and secondary research, and evaluated
        the
        data to create actionable recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, due to the significant lack of data on women of colour founders, especially in Germany, this report
        took a
        qualitative research approach for the researchers to gain an understanding of the problems and perspectives of
        this
        under-researched demographic. It also allowed us to develop concepts and theories for future research.

        To get a holistic understanding of the current state of entrepreneurship for women of colour founders in Europe,
        the
        researchers gathered data through both primary sources like interviews and secondary sources such as academic
        journals
        and periodicals.
    </p>
    <h4>By utilising the CSS methodology and qualitative research approach, we were able to:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Foster trust between the interviewee and interviewer, since they share a similar background and experience
        </li>
        <li>Amplify the voices of those whose views are historically excluded</li>
        <li>Provide rich descriptive data and insights into complex phenomena</li>
    </ul>
