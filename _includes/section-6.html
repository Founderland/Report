        Funding Stages: Also known as funding rounds are a means of getting financial capital in order to finance a
        startupâ€™s
        costs of operations, such as personnel and marketing. Startups typically go through multiple stages depending on
        their
        needs during their lifecycle, which are as follows: 7, 8, 9
        Pre-seed: Typically the first round of institutional funding that a startup raises from dedicated venture
        capital funds,
        angel investors, and/or accelerators/incubators. Generally, this round allows the founding team to find
        product-market
        fit, hire early employees, and test various go-to-market strategies
        Seed: One of the early funding stages. Typically, capital is raised from institutional investors such as
        dedicated
        venture capital funds, angel investors, and/or accelerators/incubators. The founding team will use this capital
        to
        further develop their product, go-to-market strategy, operations, and team. A startup in this stage has little
        to no
        revenue
        Series Funding: After demonstrating a viable business model, product-market fit, and a strong strategy with
        growth
        potential, startups are able to go into series funding, which starts with Series A, followed by Series B, Series
        C, etc.
        During this round, investors expect to see steady traction and for the capital raised to be used to increase
        revenue

        Venture Capital (VC): a form of private equity and type of financing that investors provide to startups that
        they
        believe have long-term growth potential. The idea is to invest in a company until it reaches a sufficient size
        and
        credibility for investors to eventually exit (e.g., sale of company or IPO) 10, 11
        Business Angel/ Angel Investor: A private individual, often with a high net worth and business experience, who
        directly
        invests capital into a startup in exchange for ownership equity or convertible debt 12, 13
        Bootstrapping: A situation in which an entrepreneur starts a company with little capital, relying on money other
        than
        outside investment, such as using their personal finances or the operating revenue to fund the company
