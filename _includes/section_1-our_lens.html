<p>Over the last two decades, there has been a global rise in entrepreneurial activity, as well as an increase in activities and initiatives dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups such as women and ethnic minority startup founders. Despite this, these groups represent an abysmal fraction of founders that receive startup funding. In 2020, only 800 woman-founded startups received funding, which translates to barely 4% of the $300 billion in global venture capital funding (source).</p>
<p>Additionally, underrepresented founders are often grouped into homogeneous networks based on a unifying characteristic (e.g., female founders) that disregards the influences of other social constructs like socio-economic class and migration status. By amassing founders into single axis dichotomies (e.g., male/female or white/PoC), policymakers, DEI initiatives, and ecosystem players are inadequately addressing the mutually reinforcing nature of inequality. Sadly, entrepreneurial research has also traditionally explored founders' experiences through single social categories.</p>
<p>For this reason, our research adopts an intersectional approach to gain a holistic perspective on the influence of various social constructs on women of color founders' motivation, experiences, and strategies for navigating the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this report, you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gain an understanding of the current situation concerning entrepreneurship for women of color</li>
    <li>Become aware of the current challenges and opportunities for this group of founders</li>
    <li>Learn about opportunities to create positive impact</li>
</ul>

        <p>Founderland gUG is a non-profit organization focused on building a new inclusive, intersectional standard for entrepreneurs. Their work supports women of color founders navigating the entrepreneurial ecosystem by providing them with a safe space to network, share knowledge, and build their ventures.</p>

        <p>In July 2021, CoAct (a project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme) held an open call for European Civil Society Initiatives to conduct Citizen Social Science (CSS) Research. Founderland was selected in the Gender Equality & Sustainable Cities and Communities category and provided with additional mentorship from faculty at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP).</p>

<p>In line with the Citizen Social Science methodology, four women of color founders from Founderland's community were selected as co-researchers, which meant that they actively took on the role of researchers by conducting both primary and secondary research.
