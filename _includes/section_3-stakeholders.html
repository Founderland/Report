<h1>Stakeholders along the Entrepreneurial Journey</h1>
<p>Who is the report for and our hypotheses about why there is a misalignment</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Women founders are not a homogenous group</li>
    <li>Founders are judged based on numerous factors outside of just gender and ethnicity. They are assessed on their migrant status, socio-economic status, family status, etc. Additionally, the opportunities and challenges allotted to them are also because of these factors</li>
    <li>You will get an understanding of the current entrepreneurial landscape, insights into the experiences of these founders, and actionable steps to support the creation of a level playing field</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intersectionality</h2>
<h3>What is intersectionality?</h3>
<p>The term intersectionality was first coined in 1989 by professor Kimberlé Crenshaw to describe the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class and other forms of discrimination “intersect” to create unique experiences of oppression and privelege (source 1,  source 2, source 3).</p>
<p>The theory of intersectionality acknowledges that the interconnection between social categorizations (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status) can expose individuals to advantages and disadvantages that uniquely shape their experiences, as well as their social standing. The concept can be seen in almost all facets of life. For example, black women face disadvantage based on both race and gender. Similarly, working-class gay men might face discrimination due to both their social class and sexual identity. Examples can also be seen practically in life. For example, a black man and a white woman make $0.74 and $0.78 to a white man's dollar.</p>

<h3>Implications in the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem</h3>
<p>In Germany, there has been a significant uptake in DEI initiatives in the entrepreneurial ecosystem targeted at single dichotomy networks such as women entrepreneurs and migrant founders. While created with positive intentions, research has found that the creation of these homogenous groups can lead to counterproductive effects such as further marginalizing minorities within the group due to inadequate responses to intersectional discrimination.</p>
<p>The theory of intersectionality postulates that all forms of inequality are “mutually reinforcing and must therefore be analyzed and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form from reinforcing another'' (source 1). Naturally, it is not possible to simultaneously address all forms of discrimation. As a result, this report aims to shed light on the heterogeneity of women entrepreneurs and how they are distinctly positioned in their journeys due to factors such as socio-economic status, ethnicity, age, parental status, and more.</p>

<h3>Motivators</h3>

<p>Academic research has found that there is no conclusive difference between men's and women’s motivation to start a business. Instead, founders are influenced by factors such as psychological motivations (e.g., achievement), economic necessity, environmental influence, and opportunities for social mobility (source). Likewise, the founders in our study highlighted three reasons for wanting to start their venture:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Experiences of discrimination</li>
    <li>Passion. Purpose. Freedom</li>
    <li>Background & Prior Experience</li>
</ul>
<h3>Experiences of Discrimination</h3>
<p>Discrimination is an all-encompassing term for unjust treatment based on the groups, classes, and categories that an individual belongs to or is perceived to belong to (source).</p>
<p>During the research process, experiences of discrimination were noted as a reason these founders decided to create their ventures and embark on their entrepreneurial journey.</p>

    <blockquote>“I felt like I was hitting a ceiling and it already took a lot for me to get there… and having kids did not help. It definitely made people not consider me for new positions and opportunities. That's where I said, 'Okay, if I'm going to create something, move up, and build my own success story, I have to do my own thing.'”</blockquote>

<h3>The Glass Ceiling</h3>
<div class="md:columns-2 md:gap-6 md:pb-8">
    <p>One of the most notable forms of discrimination faced by this demographic of founders before starting their companies were the prejudicial barriers that hindered career mobility, also known as “The Glass Ceiling”. The glass ceiling is an unacknowledged barrier to professional advancement due to discrimination such as racism and sexism. It especially affects women and members of minority communities (source).</p>
    <p>Research has found that the appealing opportunity to have more control over their careers is a major motivator for women to leave their corporate careers to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors (source pg. 4). According to the second annual Global Entrepreneurship survey, 61% of founders shared that becoming their own boss was a motivator for starting their company. 62% of women cited unfair treatment such as fewer opportunities (33%) for promotion and unequal pay (31%) in previous roles as the catalyst for starting a business.</p>
    <p>Similarly, 43% of the women surveyed shared that they delayed starting a family for fear that it would negatively impact their careers. Another study found that women with children are 79% less likely to be hired than women without children (source).</p>

    <p>Sadly, other founders shared that despite their desire to stay in the workforce, experiences of racism and discrimination forced them out.</p>

<figure>
    <blockquote>"I was forced to leave my job because of discrimination, and after that, I became so lonely and isolated... The idea (for my business) came because I asked myself, 'Why do people hate each other or discriminate?' The answer is because they don't know each other."</blockquote>

<div class="md:columns-2 md:gap-6 md:pb-8">
    <p class="lead">Experiences of discrimination take on numerous forms. For some, it can occur prior to getting a job.</p>
    <p>For example, the German Federal Anti-Discrimination agency found that people with "foreign-sounding names" were 24% less likely than those with German names to be called in for an interview (source). Of the 2.27 million unemployed people in Germany in 2019, the Federal Employment Agency said that an overwhelming 46% of those people were not ethnic Germans, despite the fact that they are only 23% of the population. Findings like these indicate that discrimination can have a significant impact on employment opportunities, which can prompt groups facing discrimination to choose self-employment.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pandemic, workplace discimination was growing 10-15 percent annually in Germany, which saw a significant increase to almost 79% during the pandemic (source). According to the Global Entrepreneurship survey, 62% of women entrepreneurs shared that they wanted to start a business due to unfair treatment at the workplace (source). Despite these negative experiences, the founders were able to channel the hardships to create impactful businesses, which segues into the next motivator for starting a venture: Mission. Impact. Purpose.</p>
</div>

<h3>Mission. Purpose. Passion.</h3>
[word cloud]
<p>According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, nearly 45% of the world's social entrepreneurs are female. Within Germany, the portion is higher at nearly 50% (source). Similarly, research has uncovered that ethnic minority founders are twice as likely to start a social enterprise. Based on these insights, it comes as no surprise that over 80% of the founders interviewed have founded impact ventures.</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote>"It's time for me to try (entrepreneurship) and really solve a problem that I'm passionate about."</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>Whether driven by experiences of discrimination or the desire to work on a mission that resonates with their interests, it is clear from the research that this group of founders are intrinsically motivated to create positive impact. For some founders, the opportunity to be the role model that they never got the opportunity to meet when they were growing up. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Survey, 80% of respondents shared that becoming a role model was a major motivation for starting a business. Others share their desire to dismantle the glass ceiling by hiring more diverse talent and closing the pay gap, were prime motivators. Others shared a strong desire to create a better future for younger generations by creating ventures focused on sustainable models such as reducing waste and recycling.</p>
